## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This tool is intended for **legitimate security testing and educational purposes only**. Users are responsible for ensuring they have proper authorization before using generated wordlists for password testing. The authors are not responsible for any misuse of this software.

```

## üéØ Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Launch the application:**
```bash
python passcode_generator.py
```

2. **Configure settings:**
   - Set minimum and maximum password lengths
   - Choose which generation methods to include
   - Enter personal data (dates, names, words)

3. **Generate wordlist:**
   - Click "Generate Passcodes"
   - Choose save location
   - Wait for completion

### Configuration Options

#### Length Settings
- **Minimum Length**: 1-50 characters
- **Maximum Length**: 1-50 characters

#### Generation Methods

**‚úÖ Common Passwords & Patterns**
- 200+ most common passwords
- Keyboard patterns (qwerty, asdf, etc.)
- Number sequences (123, 321, 1234, etc.)
- Years (1969-2025)

**‚úÖ Case Variations**
- **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Generates ALL possible upper/lowercase combinations
- Example: "hello" ‚Üí hello, Hello, hEllo, heLlo, helLo, hellO, HEllo, etc.
- Can generate millions of variations from just a few words

**‚úÖ Smart Combinations**
- Combines common passwords with your personal data
- Creates intelligent patterns like: password+1990, john+123456, admin+yourname

**‚úÖ Date-Based Passcodes**
- Enter important dates (birthdays, anniversaries, etc.)
- Automatically extracts and formats dates multiple ways
- Combines dates with common prefixes/suffixes

**‚úÖ Word-Based Passcodes**
- Enter important words, names, places
- Generates variations with numbers and special characters
- Includes leetspeak conversions

**‚úÖ Random Passcodes**
- Generates completely random alphanumeric passwords
- Configurable quantity (1-100,000)

### Example Input/Output

**Input:**
- Date: `01/15/1990`
- Name: `john`
- Enable case variations: ‚úÖ

**Sample Output (subset of thousands):**
```
password1990
john123456
JOHN1990!
Password01151990
qwerty1990
JoHn123
p4ssw0rd1990
admin_john
1990password
john_1990@
```

## üìä Output Size Expectations

| Configuration | Approximate Output |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Basic (no personal data) | 50,000 - 200,000 passcodes |
| With personal data | 500,000 - 2,000,000 passcodes |
| **Case variations enabled** | **5,000,000 - 50,000,000+ passcodes** |
| All options enabled | **10GB+ wordlists possible** |

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Command Line Tips

**Check file sizes:**
```bash
ls -lh *.txt
```

**Combine multiple wordlist files:**
```bash
cat passwords_part*.txt > combined_wordlist.txt
```

**Remove duplicates from combined files:**
```bash
sort combined_wordlist.txt | uniq > unique_wordlist.txt
```

### Integration with Security Tools

**Hashcat:**
```bash
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlist.txt
```

**John the Ripper:**
```bash
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt hashes.txt
```

**Hydra:**
```bash
hydra -l username -P wordlist.txt target-ip service
```

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

### For Large Wordlists
1. **Disable case variations** unless specifically needed
2. **Limit personal data** to most relevant items
3. **Use SSD storage** for faster file operations
4. **Ensure adequate RAM** (8GB+ recommended for large lists)
5. **Close other applications** during generation

### Memory Management
- The application automatically manages memory for large datasets
- Files are written in chunks to prevent memory overflow
- Progress is saved incrementally

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Can't find a usable init.tcl" Error:**
```bash
# Reinstall Python from python.org (not Microsoft Store)
# Or install PyQt5 alternative:
pip install PyQt5
```

**Out of Memory Error:**
- Reduce the scope of generation (disable case variations)
- Close other applications
- Use a machine with more RAM

**Slow Generation:**
- Disable case variations for faster processing
- Reduce number of personal data entries
- Use SSD storage instead of HDD

**File Too Large:**
- Files are automatically split at 1GB
- Use the split files individually or combine as needed

### Performance Benchmarks

| System Specs | Generation Time | Output Size |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| 8GB RAM, SSD | 2-5 minutes | 1-5 million passcodes |
| 16GB RAM, SSD | 5-15 minutes | 10-50 million passcodes |
| 4GB RAM, HDD | 10-30 minutes | 1-5 million passcodes |

## üîí Security Considerations

### Ethical Use
- Only use on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Comply with local laws and regulations

### Data Privacy
- Personal data entered is only used for wordlist generation
- No data is transmitted or stored externally
- Clear sensitive data from input fields after use
